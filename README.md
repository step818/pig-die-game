# {Pig Die}

#### A program that allows users to play a game with one die where they try to be the first player to reach a sum of 100. 04/10/19

#### By ** Kyle Harrington, Stephen Trewick**

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JS/JQuery where 2-4 players take turns repeatedly "rolling" a single die. If a player rolls a "1", their turn is over. Players may decide to "bank" their score after each roll, or take a gamble and continue rolling which jeopardizes the current roll. If they do not bank their current score before rolling a "1", they lose all currently un-banked points, and the next players turn begins.
